# CakeParkWebSite

I have made this website "Cake Park" using primarly HTML, CSS and Javascript and a little bit of bootstrap. The reason for choosing the theme of a cake shop is because it is our family run business. The css code seems much longer because I have added responsiveness to the page to fit different screen size.

RESPONSIVE ELEMENTS

When the website is viewed on a phones screen. The navigation bar disappears and a new bar icon will appear. clicking this will change the icon to X and forth. I have used javascript in this part.

LOGIN/SIGNUP

I have added a login?signup page completely ready in this same page.

FURTHER PLANS

soon i will be adding prduct page and add backend to the website with database for the user data  and data authentication system for the login page.
